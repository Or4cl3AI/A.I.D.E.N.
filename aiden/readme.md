# A.I.D.E.N. (Artificial Intelligence Development and Engineering Network)

Aiden is an autonomous AI agent that can analyze different types of user input like a text description or a GitHub repository link. Aiden analyzes the repository, recommends, and generates the appropriate autonomous AI agents for different tasks. Aiden and the different agents can communicate with each other through a shared database, a message queue, or a direct communication channel, allowing the agents to collaborate and finish the project.

## Technologies Used

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
- Machine Learning (ML)
- Deep Learning (DL)
- Decision Management (DML)

## Functions of Aiden

- Analyze the user's input to understand the project's needs.
- Recommend the appropriate agents for the different tasks.
- Generate the appropriate agents for the different tasks.
- Deploy the agents to the appropriate environment.
- Communicate with the agents through a shared database, a message queue, or a direct communication channel.

## How to Use

1. Import the main Aiden module: `import aiden`
2. Create an instance of Aiden: `aiden_instance = aiden.Aiden()`
3. Analyze user input: `aiden_instance.analyze_input(user_input)`
4. Recommend agents: `recommended_agents = aiden_instance.recommend_agents()`
5. Generate agents: `generated_agents = aiden_instance.generate_agents(recommended_agents)`
6. Deploy agents: `aiden_instance.deploy_agents(generated_agents)`
7. Communicate with agents: `aiden_instance.communicate_agents()`
